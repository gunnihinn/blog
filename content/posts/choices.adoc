I only have time to work on the arXiv project so often, so I'm taking a lot of
time between sessions to think about what I'm doing. When I look at my system
design notes, I feel like all the decisions I'm making are the obvious choices,
but they also were not at all obvious when I started thinking about them. It's a
good feeling.
