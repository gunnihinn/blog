I haven't made a lot of progress on my projects. I _did_ create a Scaleway VM
and shoved an OAI harvester on there that's happily downloading the arXiv's
backlog of metadata. I can also parse the XML it fetches, and have some ideas
about how I'm going to store it.

This lack of progress mostly comes from me being nerd-sniped into thinking
about bounded queues under load. My 
https://github.com/bookingcom/carbonapi/issues/35[old work project]
wanted to use a FIFO queue to hold its requests. That is a bad idea, because
FIFO queues perform very poorly under load, as I 
https://github.com/gunnihinn/queuesim[went a little overboard]
in demonstrating.

Funnily enough, that very simple thing is one of my most popular Github
projects ever.
